# Federal Law Preempts the NCPPA and Other State Data Trespass Laws to the Extent that They Impose Liability on Employees for Conduct Protected Under the National Labor Relations Act

## NLRA Preemption

### Scope of Preemption

The preemptive sweep of federal labor law is particularly broad:

> When it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under § 8, due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield. To leave the States free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law.[^preemption1]

> If employee conduct is protected under § 7, then state law which interferes with the exercise of these federally protected rights creates an actual conflict and is pre-empted by direct operation of the Supremacy Clause.[^preemption1a]

BASIS OF PREEMPTION: Protect national labor policy and preserve NLRB's exclusive original jurisdiction over labor disputes. 

> Cases that have held state authority to be pre-empted by federal law tend to fall into one of two categories: (1) those that reflect the concern that “one forum would enjoin, as illegal, conduct which the other forum would find legal” and (2) those that reflect the concern “that the (application of state law by) state courts would restrict the exercise of rights guaranteed by the Federal Acts.” “(I)n referring to decisions holding state laws pre-empted by the NLRA, care must be taken to distinguish pre-emption based on federal protection of the conduct in question . . . from that based predominantly on the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board . . ., although the two are often not easily separable.”[^preemption1b]

"Local interests" exception under Garmon.[^preemption2] 

> If the state law regulates conduct that is actually protected by federal law, however, pre-emption follows not as a matter of protecting primary jurisdiction, but as a matter of substantive right. Where, as here, the issue is one of an asserted substantive conflict with a federal enactment, then "[t] he relative importance to the State of its own law is not material ... for the Framers of our Constitution provided that the federal law must prevail."[^preemption2b]

Why it doesn't apply to NCPPA.[^preemption3] 

Accordingly, if an employer sues an employee under the NCPPA or other state data trespass law, based on workplace recording or other conduct arguably protected under the NLRA, the claim will be preempted.[^preemption4] A state court may not decide whether the conduct is indeed protected, as that question is within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the NLRB.[^preemption4a] Rather, as long as there is any colorable argument for NLRA protection, the state court should dismiss (or stay its proceedings pending a decision by the NLRB).[^preemption4b] 



### Procedure for Asserting Preemption 

"A claim of Garmon preemption is a claim that the state court has no power to adjudicate the subject matter of the case, and when a claim of Garmon preemption is raised, it must be considered and resolved by the state court."[^preemption5] Federal courts also lack subject matter jurisdiction over claims within the NLRB's primary jurisdiction.[^preemption5a] Accordingly, Garmon preemption is not a basis for removal.[^preemption5b] But, since Garmon preemption is a question of federal law, "if the state court errs in determining whether Garmon principles deprive it of jurisdiction over a dispute, review of that decision may be had in the Supreme Court."[^preemption5c]

However, the employee may obtain more immediate relief from the NLRB or a federal court. It is an unfair labor practice for an employer to maintain a preempted suit against an employee or union for protected concerted activity. [^preemption6] Accordingly, an employee faced with such a suit may file an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB, which may then order the employer to seek dismissal or a stay (pending the NLRB's disposition of the unfair labor practice charge) of the state court action.[^preemption6a] The NLRB may also bring an action in a federal district court seeking an injunction for that purpose.[^preemption6b] 

Alternatively, the employee may bring an action in federal court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to block the state court action.[^preemption7] BUT DO THE ANTI-INJUNCTION ACT OR YOUNGER ABSTENTION APPLY WHERE A PRIVATE PARTY SEEKS TO ENJOIN A PREEMPTED STATE COURT SUIT, RATHER THAN A STATE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING (AS IN BUD ANTLE)? 


## Preemption Under Other Federal Employment Laws

Admissibility in agency actions and employee suits of recordings made or evidence otherwise collected without the employer's permission. The Wyoming statutes state that data collected in violation of those statutes is inadmissible in any proceeding. ANY OTHER AG-GAG STATUTES HAVE SIMILAR PROVISIONS? Even without such an explicit exlusionary provision, other ag-gag and data trespass statutes would have the practical effect of deterring employees from using unauthorized workplace recordings as evidence of employment law violations and subjecting them to criminal or civil liability for doing so. 


[^preemption1]: @Garmon1959 [p. 244]. Federal law may also preempt state regulation of "conduct neither protected by § 7 nor prohibited by § 8," where "Congress intended [it] to be 'unrestricted by Any governmental power to regulate' because it was among the permissible 'economic weapons in reserve, . . . actual exercise (of which) on occasion by the parties, is part and parcel of the system that the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts have recognized.'" @MachinistsWisconsinEmployment1976 [p. 141] (citation omitted)
