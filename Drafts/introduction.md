# Introduction

At least eleven states have enacted laws against unauthorized photography, recording, or other data collection on private property.[^Intro1] Among the most recent examples is the North Carolina Property Protection Act ("NCPPA").[^Intro2] 

The NCPPA represents a new approach to state laws against data trespass,[^Intro3] differing from previous ag-gag laws in three significant respects. First, unlike laws limited to agricultural facilities, the NCPPA applies more broadly to any private property.[^Intro4] Second, while previous laws typically imposed criminal liability,[^Intro5] the NCPPA creates a civil cause of action for acts exceeding the scope of authorized entry to the premises.[^Intro6] Third, the NCPPA specifically targets unauthorized recording and other data collection by employees.[^Intro7]

The focus of this article is on this last issue. At least some of the employee activity subject to civil liability under the NCPPA and other state data trespass laws[^Intro8] is protected under the National Labor Relations Act ("NLRA")[^Intro8a] and other federal laws.[^Intro8b] The Supremacy Clause dictates that this conflict must be resolved in favor of federal law under the preemption doctrine.[^Intro9]

The NCPPA and other state data trespass statutes have faced legal challenges on constitutional grounds.[^Intro10] However, the courts have not addressed the issue of federal preemption.[^Intro11] Existing scholarship on state data trespass laws has likewise focused primarily on the First Amendment and other constitutional problems, with little attention to the impairment of workers' rights under federal labor and employment law.[^Intro12]

This article aims to address this gap. Focusing on the NCPPA because of its explicit targeting of employee activity, it offers guidance to courts in recognizing and avoiding conflicts between employee liability under state data trespass laws and employee protections under the National Labor Relations Act and other federal labor law. To ensure that the prospect of costly litigation and damages does not penalize employees for, or deter them from, exercising their rights under federal law, I argue that preemption should apply to any state data trespass claims against employees who make recordings or otherwise collect information in the workplace pertaining to their terms and conditions of employment.

[^Intro1]: @animalwelfareinstitute2022 []; @CenterforConstitutionalRights2017 [p. 10]. States that have adopted such laws include (in chronological order): Kansas, Montana, North Dakota, Alabama, Iowa, Missouri, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, North Carolina, and Arkansas. @CenterforConstitutionalRights2017 [p. 10, 13, 15-16, 18-20]. The earliest of these laws applied specifically to agricultural facilities, giving rise to the sobriquet "ag-gag" laws. See @CenterforConstitutionalRights2017 [p. 2-3]; @Sanders2019 [p. 493-94]. 

[^Intro2]: @NCPropertyProtection2016 []. Arkansas has adopted a similar statute. @ArkansasDataTrespass2017 []; see @ALDFvVaught2020-EDArk [n.4] ("Representative Vaught ... explained in introducing the Arkansas Ag-Gag law to the House Judiciary Committee that it 'is modeled after a newly enacted law in North Carolina in 2016.'"). 

[^Intro3]: I use the term "data trespass" to encompass laws imposing criminal or civil liability for unauthorized recording or data collection, whether limited to agricultural facilities or (as in North Carolina, Arkansas, and Wyoming) covering other premises and facilities as well. See @solomonWyomingDataTrespass2016 [] (describing Wyoming statutes as "data trespass laws"); @kurtzWyomingFederalCourt2016 [] (same). 

[^Intro4]: @NCPropertyProtection2016 []. The Arkansas statute similarly prohibits unauthorized recording on "commercial property", which is defined to include any "business property", "Agricultural or timber production operations", and "Residential property used for business purposes".  @ArkansasDataTrespass2017 []. Wyoming's resource data collection statutes also apply to any "private land", but their prohibitions are limited to unauthorized collection of "resource data" (defined as "data relating to land or land use, including but not limited to data regarding agriculture, minerals, geology, history, cultural artifacts, archeology, air, water, soil, conservation, habitat, vegetation or animal species"). @WyomingCriminalTrespass2015 [] (imposing criminal liability) and @WyomingCivilTrespass2015 [] (establishing civil cause of action).

[^Intro5]: See @CenterforConstitutionalRights2017 [p. 6, 10-11, 14, 17-18].

[^Intro6]: @NCPropertyProtection2016 []; @ArkansasDataTrespass2017 []. Some other states' laws also authorize private civil actions by the owner or operator of the facility. 

[^Intro7]: @NCPropertyProtection2016 [secs. (b)(1)-(3)]; @ArkansasDataTrespass2017 [secs. (c)(1)-(3)]. Some ag-gag statutes contain specific provisions aimed at so-called "employment fraud" for the purpose of gaining access to an agricultural facility. See, e.g., @IdahoAgriculturalProduction2014 [ ] (imposing liability on one who "Obtains employment with an agricultural production facility by force, threat, or misrepresentation with the intent to cause economic or other injury"); @IowaAgFraud2012 []; @AlabamaAgGag2002 []; see also @CenterforConstitutionalRights2017 [p. 2, 10-11].

[^Intro8b]: See Part 3.  

[^Intro9]: See Part 4.

[^Intro10]: @PETAvNCFarmBureau2023 [] (North Carolina); @ALDFvVaught2021 (Arkansas); @ALDFvKelly2021-10thCir [] (Kansas); @ALDFvReynolds2022-SDIowa [] (Iowa); @ALDFvWasden2018-9thCir [] (Idaho); @WesternWatersheds2018-DWyoming [] (Wyoming); @ALDFvHerbert2017 [] (Utah).  

[^Intro11]: In at least two cases, labor organizations filed amicus briefs arguing that the imposition of employee liability under state ag-gag statutes would conflict with and undermine protections under federal labor and employment law. See United Farm Workers of America brief as amicus curiae in ALDF v. Wasden; Idaho Building Trades Council & Idaho AFL-CIO brief as amicus curiae in ALDF v. Wasden; United Farm Workers of America, brief as amicus curiae in ALDF v. Kelly; United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, brief as amicus curiae in ALDF v. Kelly. In @ALDFvKelly2021-10thCir [at n.6], the 10th Circuit explicitly declined to consider whether the Kansas ag-gag statute violated the NLRA, because the parties themselves had not presented the issue. In @ALDFvWasden2018-9thCir [], the 9th Circuit held that parts of the Idaho ag-gag statute violated the 1st Amendment, without mentioning federal labor preemption at all.
