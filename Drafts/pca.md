# The NCPPA and Other State Data Trespass Laws Subject Employees to Liability for Conduct that is Protected Under Federal Labor Law

The NCPPA expressly targets employee activity.[^PCA1] Most notably, this includes unauthorized recording or other data collection on the employer's premises. It may also include union "salting", communicating with co-workers and the public about working conditions, and providing information and evidence about possible legal violations to federal agencies. These activities are (at least in some circumstances) protected under federal labor law.

As a threshold matter, the protections of federal labor law apply only to those who fit within the statutory definition of an employee. Certain categories of employees are excluded from coverage, notably agricultural laborers.[^PCA2] While this exclusion might appear to alleviate any conflict with state laws that apply only to agricultural facilities, that is not necessarily the case. The agricultural laborer exclusion applies only to those engaged directly in farming,[^PCA3] or who "perform tasks which are incidental to or in conjunction with [the employer's] farming operations,"[^PCA4] such as "processing agricultural products … grown on the premises of the farm itself."[^PCA5] However, it does not apply to those who are not employed by a "farmer",[^PCA6] nor to those who process, distribute, or otherwise handle agricultural goods not grown or raised by the employer for use in its own farming operations.[^PCA7]

In contrast, ag-gag laws define agricultural facilities more broadly, to include not just farms but also other operations along the production, processing, and distribution chain.[^PCA8] Consequently, the NLRA applies to at least some employees of agricultural facilities covered by state ag-gag laws.

## Protected Activity Under the NLRA

Section 7 of the NLRA "protect[s] the right of workers to act together to better their working conditions":[^PCA9]

> Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection ....[^PCA10]

It is an unfair labor practice under Section 8(a)(1) for an employer "to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7".[^PCA11]

Concerted activity pertaining to "terms, tenure or conditions of employment"[^PCA12] is protected under Section 7 regardless of whether employees have organized or are seeking to organize in a labor union, and even absent "a specific demand upon their employer to remedy a condition they find objectionable".[^PCA13] Activity aimed at protecting the rights or advancing the interests of multiple employees is "concerted" for purposes of Section 7, even if undertaken by a single employee acting alone. 

> Nor can we accept the company’s contention that because it admittedly had an established plant rule which forbade employees to leave their work without permission of the foreman, there was justifiable “cause” for discharging these employees, wholly separate and apart from any concerted activities in which they engaged in protest against the poorly heated plant. Section 10(c) of the Act does authorize an employer to discharge employees for “cause” and our cases have long recognized this right on the part of an employer. But this, of course, cannot mean that an employer is at liberty to punish a man by discharging him for engaging in concerted activities which § 7 of the Act protects.[^PCA14]

Under current Board law, an employer's facially neutral work rule that might apply to some protected Section 7 activity does not necessarily violate Section 8(a)(1).[^PCA15] However, it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to enforce such a rule against an employee for conduct protected under Section 7.[^PCA16]

### Recording & Other Data Collection

Section 7 protects employees who take photographs, make audio or video recordings, or use other means to collect information about workplace conditions, communications, or activity for the purpose of mutual aid and protection.[^PCA17] Employees may also use "surreptitious" or otherwise unauthorized recordings as evidence in administrative or judicial proceedings to vindicate their legal rights.[^PCA18]

Employees are subject to liability under the NCPPA for recording or data collection in the non-public areas of the workplace "without authorization". It is unclear whether "without authorization" simply means that the employee violates an employer's rule prohibiting or restricting such activity, or if it means the employee must obtain the employer's affirmative permission even where there is no general anti-recording rule in place. Either way, there is a conflict with the protection that the NLRA extends to employees who make recordings or otherwise collect information in the workplace in the exercise of their rights under Section 7.

### Salting

The NCPPA imposes liability on unauthorized data collection or recording by "An employee who enters the nonpublic areas of an employer's premises _for a reason other than a bona fide intent of seeking or holding employment_ or doing business with the employer."[^PCA19]

This provision could be construed to apply to union "salts": union members who take jobs at non-union workplaces with the aim of organizing the employees.[^PCA20] Salts sometimes identify themselves as union members and organizers when applying for jobs,[^PCA21] but sometimes keep their affiliation and motive covert.[^PCA22] In the latter circumstance, the employer may very well regard the concealment as a misrepresentation. Employers wishing to avoid unions no doubt regard salting as harmful to their economic interests.[^PCA23]

Employee protections under the NLRA apply to those engaged in salting,[^PCA24], whether overt or covert,[^PCA25] as long as they are "genuinely interested in seeking to establish an employment relationship with the employer."[^PCA26] 

MIGHT BE OK IF LIABILITY UNDER NCPPA & OTHER STATE LAWS IS LIMITED TO THOSE WHO OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF CAUSING INJURY, OR WITH NO Bona Fide INTEREST IN THE JOB ITSELF. NOTE AMBIGUITY IN LANGUAGE OF NCPPA.[^PCA27] But, as written, "employment fraud" provisions in these statutes at least plausibly cover those with mixed motives, who would be regarded as statutory employees under the NLRA. This is particularly true of the NCPPA, which explicitly identifies those subject to liability as "employees" and further predicates their liability on the use of recordings or other information "to breach the person's duty of loyalty to the employer." 

### Communication with Co-Workers & Public

Employees under the NLRA also have a right to communicate with co-workers and the public about working conditions and disputes.[^PCA28]



### Providing Information and Evidence to Federal Agencies

The NLRA protects the right of employees to petition for a union representation election, file complaints of unfair labor practices with the NLRB, and testify at NLRB proceedings.

By impairing the ability of employees to document workplace conditions and activity, the NCPPA undermines the NLRB's procedures for vindicating employee's rights under the NLRA.[^PCA29]

Disclosure of information to state officials is exempt from liability under the NCPPA. However, the statute contains no exemption for disclosures to federal agencies or officials. 

## Disloyalty Under the NLRA

Concerted activity may lose protection under the NLRA if it amounts to disloyalty to the employer. For example, "sharp, public, disparaging attack[s] upon the quality of the company’s product and its business policies, in a manner reasonably calculated to harm the company’s reputation and reduce its income" may be unprotected, even if made in connection with a labor dispute.[^PCA30]

[^PCA27]: There might still be problems in relation to other federal employment laws. For example, the use of "tester" applicants is a common practice for identifying discriminatory hiring practices.

[^PCA28]: @KinderCareLearningCenters1990 [].

[^PCA29]: The NCPPA and other data trespass laws similarly undermine the enforcement of other federal laws that protect employees against health and safety hazards, discrimination, wage theft, and other harmful and abusive employment practices,  Employers are hardly likely to grant employees permission to collect evidence of such violations, and may very well attempt to cover up the problems if alerted that employees are planning to do so. Consequently, to substantiate claims of unlawful working conditions or employer conduct, employees must frequently take photos, make audio-video recordings, or copy documents without the employer's knowledge and consent. See United Farm Workers Amicus Brief.
