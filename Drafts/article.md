abstract: |
  The North Carolina Property Protection Act creates a civil cause of action against "Any person who intentionally gains access to the nonpublic areas of another's premises and engages in an act that exceeds the person's authority to enter those areas â€¦". The statute specifically targets employees who engage in unauthorized recording or other data collection on the employer's premises. At least some of the employee activity subject to civil liability under these statutes is protected under federal labor and employment laws. The Supremacy Clause dictates that this conflict must be resolved in favor of federal law. To ensure that the prospect of costly litigation and damages does not penalize employees for, or deter them from, exercising their rights under federal law, preemption should apply to any NCPPA claims arising from employee conduct that is even arguably protected.
