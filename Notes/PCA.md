title: Protected Concerted Activity 

--- 

## PCA Generally

McGinley & McGinley-Stempel, 30 Hofstra Lab. & Emp. L. J. 75 (2012)

- "Making the distinction between concerted, protected activity and speech that is not concerted or protected is sometimes tricky because the analysis is heavily fact-dependent, and different people may interpret the facts differently." 30 Hofstra Lab. & Emp. L. J. at 90 (2012)
- The Board has exclusive original jurisdiction to make that determination. If the activity in question is even arguably protected under the NLRA, neither a state nor federal court may decide. 
- "Section 7 applies to the concerted action of all employees, whether in unionized workplaces, or whether or not they are engaged in a union campaign." 30 Hofstra Lab. & Emp. L. J. at 88, citing Bravo v. Dolsen Cos., 888 P.2d 147, 150-51 (Wash. 1995)
- "an individual can be engaged in concerted activity if he or she engages in the activity "'with or on the authority of other employees, and not solely by and on behalf of the employee himself.'" 30 Hofstra Lab. & Emp. L. J. at 89, quoting Allstate Maintenance, LLC, 367 NLRB No. 68 (January 11, 2019) 
 

NLRB v. Washington Aluminum Co., 370 U.S. 9, 14-15 (1962)

- Spontaneous walkout by non-unionized employees over workplace conditions was concerted activity. 370 U.S. at 14-15


 Halstead Metal Products v. NLRB, 940 F. 2d 66 (4th Cir. 1991)
 
- NLRA secs. 7 and 8(a)(1) "effectively insulate employees from discharge, refusal to rehire, or other employer retaliation for engaging in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection, 'even though no union activity be involved, or collective bargaining be contemplated.'" 940 F.2d at 69, quoting Joanna Cotton Mills Co. v. NLRB, 176 F.2d 749, 752-53 (4th Cir.1949).


United Merchants & Mfrs., Inc. v. NLRB, 554 F.2d 1276, 1278 (4th Cir.1977)
 
- "work stoppage and walkout by unrepresented employees for their mutual aid" was protected concerted activity. 554 F.2d at 1278, citing NLRB v. Washington Aluminum.



NLRB Office of General Counsel, Memorandum GC 21-03 (March 31, 2021)

> While protected, concerted activity can be a precursor to a union campaign, it also can occur outside of the context of union activity, such as in instances where employees raise safety concerns to their employer, or seek protection from government agencies. Nonetheless, constraints and limitations placed on employees engaging in concerted activities, and adverse actions taken against them in response to their protected activity, serve to effectively undermine the declared policy of the United States. 

Id. at 1. 

> Section 7 grants employees the right to engage in “concerted” activities for the purpose of “mutual aid or protection.” The latter element “focuses on the goal of concerted activity,” specifically, “whether there is a link between the activity and matters concerning the workplace or employees’ interests as employees.” The Board analyzes whether an activity is for “mutual aid or protection” using an objective standard; thus, employees’ subjective motives are irrelevant. The “mutual aid or protection” clause covers employee efforts to “improve their lot as employees through channels outside the immediate employee-employer relationship,” as well as activities “in support of employees of employers other than their own.”

Id at 2, citing Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market, Inc., 361 NLRB 151, 153 (2014); Eastex, Inc. v. NLRB, 437 U.S. 556, 559-60, 565 (1978)
 

> Section 7 protection applies not only to union activity and labor organizing; it may also cover the fundamental precursor actions that form the cornerstone of any other actions the employees may take, like discussing or protesting wages, hours, and working conditions. Additionally, employee advocacy can have the goal of “mutual aid or protection” even when the employees have not explicitly connected their activity to workplace concerns. This includes employees' political and social justice advocacy when the subject matter has a direct nexus to employees' “interests as employees.”

Id. at 2


The Ohio Bell Tel. Co., 370 NLRB No. 29 (Oct. 28, 2020)

> The rights guaranteed in Section 7 include the right “to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.” See Section 7 of the Act. Section 8(a)(1) of the Act provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act.

> In Meyers Industries (Meyers I), 268 NLRB 493 (1984), and in Meyers Industries (Meyers II), 281 NLRB 882 (1986), the Board held that “concerted activities” protected by Section 7 are those “engaged in with or on the authority of other employees, and not solely by and on behalf of the employee himself.” However, “the activity of a single employee in enlisting the support of his fellow employees for their mutual aid and protection is as much “‘concerted activity’ as is ordinary group activity.” Whitaker Corp., 289 NLRB 933 (1988) (quoting Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp. v. NLRB, 407 F.2d. 1357, 1365 (4th Cir. 1969). Individual action is concerted if it is engaged in with the object of initiating or inducing group action. A conversation can constitute concerted activity when “engaged in with the object of initiating or inducing or preparing for group action or [when] it [has] some relation to group action in the interest of the employees.” Meyers II, supra, 281 NLRB at 887 (quoting Mushroom Transportation Co., 330 F.2d 683, 685 (3 Cir. 1964)). The object of inducing group action, however, need not be expressed depending on the nature of the conversation. See Sabo, Inc. d/b/a Hoodview Vending Co., 359 NLRB 355, 358-359 (2012) (vacated but incorporated by law Hoodview Vending Co., 362 NLRB 690 (2015). Moreover, Meyers I and II does not require that concerted activity be well-organized or effective, it needs only be engaged in for other employees for mutual benefit. See also Stephens Media, 356 NLRB 661, 679 (2011) (finding the wearing of red arm bands to be protected concerted activity even where no evidence was offered showing management was aware of their purpose).


## Sharing information 

Under the NC (and other?) data Trespass statue(s), an employee faces liability not only for making unauthorized photos or recordings in the workplace, but also for their unauthorized dissemination, e.g. sharing copies with other employees or union representatives, or posting them on social media. But the NLRA protects employee communications, both among coworkers and with the public, about their shared concerns as employees. SOCIAL MEDIA CASES; HANDBILLING & PICKET SIGN CASES.
