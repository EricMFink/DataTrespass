title: North Carolina Property Protection Act 

---

The North Carolina Property Protection Act ("NCPPA")[^NCPPA1] provides that,

> Any person who intentionally gains access to the nonpublic areas of another's premises and engages in an act that exceeds the person's authority to enter those areas is liable to the owner or operator of the premises for any damages sustained".

The statute defines "nonpublic areas" as "those areas not accessible to or not intended to be accessed by the general public." It also enumerates defines "an act that exceeds a person's authority to enter the nonpublic areas of another's premises" as "any of the following":

> (1\) An employee who enters the nonpublic areas of an employer's premises for a reason other than a bona fide intent of seeking or holding employment or doing business with the employer and thereafter without authorization captures or removes the employer's data, paper, records, or any other documents and uses the information to breach the person's duty of loyalty to the employer.
> 
> (2\) An employee who intentionally enters the nonpublic areas of an employer's premises for a reason other than a bona fide intent of seeking or holding employment or doing business with the employer and thereafter without authorization records images or sound occurring within an employer's premises and uses the recording to breach the person's duty of loyalty to the employer.
> 
> (3\) Knowingly or intentionally placing on the employer's premises an unattended camera or electronic surveillance device and using that device to record images or data.
> 
> (4\) Conspiring in organized retail theft, as defined in Article 16A of Chapter 14 of the General Statutes.
> 
> (5\) An act that substantially interferes with the ownership or possession of real property.[^NCPPA2]

Subsections (b)(1) and (2) expressly and exclusively target employee conduct. Liability under these subsections is based on the use of information obtained through unauthorized capture or recording "to breach the person's duty of loyalty to the employer". 

Statute does not define the employee's "duty of loyalty". This is a significant omission, as it is questionable whether North Carolina law imposes any such duty on employees, absent the special circumstances establishing a fiduciary duty.[^NCPPA10] 

The legislative sponsor of the NCPPA explained that the purpose was to codify the holding in Food Lion.[^NCPPA11] That case arose out of a television news exposé in which reporters, working for the show's producers, obtained jobs at Food Lion stores and used hidden cameras to record such practices as the bleaching and relabelling of past-date foods.[^NCPPA12]  Food Lion asserted tort claims against the reporters for breach of loyalty, and the federal court concluded that North Carolina law would recognize such a claim by an employer against an employee.[^NCPPA12b] 

However, the North Carolina Supreme Court subsequently opined that the federal court in Food Lion had misinterpreted state law.[^NCPPA13] NC LAW RECOGNIZES CLAIM WHERE THERE IS A FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP.[^NCPPA13b] But the Court declined to recognize such a claim in an ordinary employment relationship.[^NCPPA1c].

THE LEGISLATURE CAN ADOPT A STATUTORY CAUSE OF ACTION WHERE NONE EXISTS AT COMMON LAW. BUT THERE IS STILL A PROBLEM. SECTIONS (b)(1) and (2) MAKE BREACH OF THE EMPLOYEE'S DUTY OF LOYALTY AN ELEMENT OF LIABILITY. BUT THIS ASSUMES THAT SUCH A DUTY IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED UNDER NC LAW. THAT'S NOT CLEAR. 

In the context of employee suits for wrongful discharge, North Carolina courts have recognized employee disloyalty as valid grounds to fire an employee.[^NCPPA14] But those cases do not clearly establish that there is any employee duty of loyalty under North Carolina law, absent the special circumstances required for a fiduciary relationship. In an at-will employment regime, the employer needs no reason at all to fire an employee. In a wrongful discharge suit, the only significance of an employee's disloyalty is as evidence that the termination did not fall within any of the recognized exceptions to the at-will rule. 




_What does "a bona fide intent of seeking or holding employment or doing business with the employer" mean? Does "a reason other than a bona fide intent ..." mean only where the employee lacks any bona fide intent, or does it also include situations where the employee has mixed motives?_


Subsection (b)(3) does not explicitly identify the class of persons who may be liable; but the fact that it prohibits the placement of unattended cameras or recording devices "on the employer's premises" implies that its application is limited to employees.[^NCPPA30] Subsections (b)(4) & (5), which restrict neither the class of potentially liable persons nor the owner or operator of the premises, would include employee conduct on an employer's premises.[^NCPPA31]


There have been a handful of suits brought under the North Carolina and Arkansas statutes. Most of these arise from alleged misappropriation of trade secrets or other proprietary information by the plaintiff's former employee of who went to work for a competitor.[^NCPPA40] None involve protected concerted activity by employees under NLRA sec. 7.

[^NCPPA31]: § 99A-2(b)(4) (Organized retail theft) would not apply to any employee conduct protected under the NLRA and thus raises no issue of federal preemption.
