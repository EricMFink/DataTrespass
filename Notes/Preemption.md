## Preemption deprives state court of jurisdiction

_Longshoremen v. Davis_, 476 US 380, 398-99 (1986)

- Garmon preemption deprives the state court of jurisdiction, and is thus not waivable. 
- Court rejects argument that “the mere lack of a conclusive determination by the Board that an activity is without the purview of the Act renders that activity arguably subject to the Act.”
- Instead, “the party asserting pre-emption must make an affirmative showing that the activity is arguably subject to the Act”. 



## No removal based on preemption


_Ethridge v. Harbor House Restaurant,_ 861 F. 2d 1389,  1399 (9th Circuit 1988)

- A preempted suit is not removable, because exclusive original jurisdiction is in the NLRB, not federal district courts.

>  the _Garmon_ analysis is not one to be undertaken by the lower federal courts. "A claim of _Garmon_ pre-emption is a claim that the state court has no power to adjudicate the subject matter of the case, and when a claim of _Garmon_-preemption is raised, _it must be considered and resolved by the state court._" _Id._ at 393, 106 S.Ct. at 1913 (emphasis added). If the state court errs in determining whether _Garmon_ principles deprive it of jurisdiction over a dispute, review of that decision may be had in the Supreme Court. _See, e.g.,_ _Davis,_ 476 U.S. at 388-89, 106 S.Ct. at 1911 (concluding that _Garmon_-preemption always supplies a federal question for the Court to review on appeal); _cf._ _Franchise Tax Bd.,_ 463 U.S. at 12 n. 12, 103 S.Ct. at 2848 n. 12.


## Establishing preemption


Wright Electric v. Ouellette (Minn Ct App 2004)

- Employer's claims, including fraud & unauthorized use of property, against former employee & union were preempted, where they were based on employee's false statements in job application. 
- Employee's conduct, as part of union salting effort, was arguably protected under the NLRA. 
- Fact that the Board declined to issue a complaint on ULP charge of over firing did not necessarily indicate Board's conclusion that conduct was unprotected. Court cites San Diego Building Trades Council


Hartman Bros. Heating & Air Conditioning v. NLRB, 280 F.3d 1110  (7th Cir. 2002)

- State statue making knowing & intentional making false or misleading statements in job application was preempted as applied to union salt.

## Remedies for preempted suit

### Injunction

_Bill Johnson's_, fn 5

- Exception to normal rule that injunction  against pending state court suit requires both retaliatiry motive & lack of good faith basis. 
- If suit is completely preempted, Federal court, upon request by the Board, may enjoin proceeding. See NLRB v. Nash Finch, 404 U.S. 138 (1971)

### ULP Charge 

Manno Elec. (NLRB 1996)
