State v. DeAngelo, 396 N.J.Super. 23 (2007)


> "the focus of the appeal is the enforceability of the ordinance that prevents the display of a large balloon in the shape of a rat during a labor dispute. We hold that the ordinance, which does not affect the parties' rights in the labor dispute, is not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C.A. ยง 151-69" ([ 2007:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/38MXRIG5?page=5))

> "Federal Preemption" ([ 2007:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/38MXRIG5?page=7))

> "Here, the dispute is solely between the State and an individual, over the application of a local ordinance and does not concern an unfair labor practice per se." ([ 2007:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/38MXRIG5?page=8))
