Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. San Diego County Dist. Council of..., 436 U.S. 180 (1978)

> "The question in this case is whether the National Labor Relations Act, as amended,1 deprives a state court of the power to entertain an action by an employer to enforce state trespass laws against picketing which is arguably—but not definitely—prohibited or protected by federal law." ([ 1978:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=5))

> "Sears asserted no claim that the picketing itself violated any state or federal law. It sought simply to remove the pickets from its property to the public walkways, and the injunction issued by the state court was strictly confined to the relief sought. Thus, as a matter of state law, the location of the picketing was illegal but the picketing itself was unobjectionable." ([ 1978:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=6))

> "if Sears had filed an unfair labor practice charge against the Union, the Board's concern would have been limited to the question whether the Union's picketing had an objective proscribed by the Act; the location of the picketing would have been irrelevant" ([ 1978:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=7))

> "if the Union had filed an unfair labor practice charge under § 8(a)(1) when Sears made a demand that the pickets leave its property, it is at least arguable that the Board would have found Sears guilty of an unfair labor practice." ([ 1978:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=7))

> "The case is not, however, one in which "it is clear or may fairly be assumed" that the subject matter which the state court sought to regulate—that is, the location of the picketing—is either prohibited or protected by the Federal Act" ([ 1978:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=7))

> "San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236, 79 S.Ct. 773" ([ 1978:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=7))

> "The first related to activity which is clearly protected or prohibited by the federal statute. The second articulated a more sweeping prophylactic rule: "When an activity is arguably subject to § 7 or § 8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations *188 Board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted." Id., at 245, two statements which have come to be accepted as the general guidelines for deciphering the unexpressed intent of Congress regarding the permissible scope of state regulation of activity touching upon labor-management relations" ([ 1978:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=7))

> "when an employer grievance against a union may be presented to the National Labor Relations *192 Board it is not subject to litigation in a state tribunal" ([ 1978:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=8))

> "This reasoning has its greatest force when applied to state laws regulating the relations between employees, their union, and their employer.21 It may also apply to certain laws of general applicability which are occasionally invoked in connection with a labor dispute." ([ 1978:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=8))

> "On the other hand, the Court has allowed a State to enforce *195 certain laws of general applicability even though aspects of the challenged conduct were arguably prohibited by § 8 of the NLRA. Thus, for example, the Court has upheld state-court jurisdiction over conduct that touches "interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, we could not infer that Congress had deprived the States of the power to act." San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S., at 244," ([ 1978:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=9))

> "The critical inquiry, therefore, is not whether the State is enforcing a law relating specifically to labor relations or one of general application but whether the controversy presented to the state court is identical to (as in Garner ) or different from (as in Farmer ) that which could have been, but was not, presented to the Labor Board." ([ 1978:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=9))

> "The question whether the arguably protected character of the Union's trespassory picketing provides a sufficient justification for pre-emption of the state court's jurisdiction over Sears' trespass claim involves somewhat different considerations." ([ 1978:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=10))

> "there is a constitutional objection to state-court interference with conduct actually protected by **1759 the Act" ([ 1978:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=10))

> "Considerations of federal supremacy, therefore, are implicated to a greater extent when labor-related activity is protected than when it is prohibited" ([ 1978:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=10))

> "Prior to granting any relief from the Union's continuing trespass, the state court was obligated to decide that the trespass was not actually protected by federal law, a determination which might entail an accommodation of Sears' property rights and the Union's § 7 rights. In an unfair labor practice proceeding initiated by the Union, the Board might have been required to make the same accommodation." ([ 1978:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=10))

> "The primary-jurisdiction rationale justifies pre-emption only in situations in which an aggrieved party has a reasonable opportunity either to invoke the Board's jurisdiction himself or else to induce his adversary to do so" ([ 1978:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=10))

> "Sears could not directly obtain a Board ruling on the question whether the **1760 Union's trespass was federally protected. Such a Board determination could have been obtained only if the Union had filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging that Sears had interfered with the Union's § 7 right to engage in peaceful picketing on Sears' property." ([ 1978:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=10))

> "The primary-jurisdiction rationale unquestionably requires that when the same controversy may be presented to the state court or the NLRB, it must be presented to the Board. But that rationale does not extend to cases in which an employer has no acceptable method of invoking, or inducing the Union to invoke, the jurisdiction of the Board" ([ 1978:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=10))

> "The danger of state interference with federally protected conduct is the principal concern of the second branch of the Garmon doctrine. To allow the exercise of state jurisdiction in certain contexts might create a significant **1761 risk of misinterpretation of federal law and the consequent prohibition of protected conduct." ([ 1978:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=11))

> "the acceptability of "arguable protection" as a justification for pre-emption in a given class of cases is, at least in part, a function of the strength of the argument that § 7 does in fact protect the disputed conduct" ([ 1978:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=11))

> "The Court has held that state jurisdiction to enforce its laws prohibiting violence,35 defamation,36 the intentional infliction of emotional distress,37 or obstruction of access to property38 is not pre-empted by the NLRA. none of those violations of state law involves protected conduct" ([ 1978:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=11))

> "In contrast, some violations of state trespass laws may be actually protected by § 7 of the federal Act." ([ 1978:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=11))

> "permitting state courts to evaluate the merits of an argument that certain trespassory activity is protected does not create an unacceptable risk of interference with conduct which the Board, and a court reviewing the Board's decision, would find protected. For while there are unquestionably examples of trespassory union activity in which the question whether it is protected is fairly debatable, experience under the Act teaches that such situations are rare and that a trespass is far more likely to be unprotected than protected."

> "nonemployee union organizers" ([ 1978:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=11))

> "If there is a strong argument that the trespass is protected in a particular case, a union can be expected to respond to an" ([ 1978:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=11))

> "employer demand to depart by filing an unfair labor practice charge; the protection question would then be decided by the agency experienced in accommodating the § 7 rights of unions and the property rights of employers in the context of a labor dispute." ([ 1978:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=12))

> "Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, concurring." ([ 1978:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=12))

> "if the union does file a **1764 charge upon being asked by the employer to leave the employer's property and continues to process the charge expeditiously, state-court jurisdiction is pre-empted until such time as the General Counsel declines to issue a complaint or the Board, applying the standards of NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U.S. 105, 76 S.Ct. 679, 100 L.Ed. 975 (1956), rules against the union and holds the picketing to be unprotected. if a union timely files a § 8(a)(1) charge, a state court would be bound to stay any pending injunctive or damages suit brought by the employer until the Board has concluded, or the General Counsel by refusal to issue a complaint has indicated, that the picketing is not protected by § 7" ([ 1978:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=12))

> "Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting." ([ 1978:14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=14))

> "When, on the other hand, the underlying conduct may be protected by the Act, the risk of interference with the federal scheme is of a different character. The danger of permitting local adjudications is not that timing or form of relief might be different from what the Board would administer, but rather that the local court might restrain" ([ 1978:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=16))

> "conduct that is in fact protected by the Act." ([ 1978:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=17))

> "By enacting § 7, Congress necessarily intended to pre-empt certain state laws: e. g., those prohibiting concerted activities as conspiracies or" ([ 1978:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=17))

> "unlawful restraints of trade." ([ 1978:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=18))

> "there is necessarily a possibility that to permit state-court jurisdiction over arguably protected conduct could fetter the exercise of rights protected by the Act and otherwise interfere with the congressional scheme. A local tribunal could recognize an activity as arguably protected, yet, given its attitude toward organized labor, lack of expertise in labor matters, and insensitive procedures, misapply or misconceive the Board's decisional criteria and restrain conduct that is within the ambit of § 7." ([ 1978:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=18))

> "the Act extensively regulates the conditions under which an employer's proprietary rights must yield to the exercise of § 7 rights," ([ 1978:19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=19))

> ""When it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under § 8, due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield. To leave the States free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law." 359 U.S., at 244" ([ 1978:24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=24))

> "the general applicability of a state cause of action is not sufficient to exempt it from pre-emption." ([ 1978:25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=25))

> "Although it is clear that a state court may not exercise jurisdiction over protected conduct, it is important to note that the word "protected" may refer to two quite different concepts: union conduct which the State may not prohibit and against which the employer may not retaliate because it is covered by § 7 or conduct which a State may not prohibit even though it is not covered by § 7 of the Act." ([ 1978:28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=28))

> "in the cases in which pre-emption exists even though neither § 7 nor § 8 of the Act is even arguably applicable, there is, by hypothesis, no opportunity for the National Labor Relations Board to make the initial evaluation of the controversy. In these cases, the pre-emption issue is necessarily addressed in the first instance by a state tribunal, and that tribunal must decide whether or not the conduct is actually privileged from governmental regulation." ([ 1978:28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBRTJ78L?page=28))
