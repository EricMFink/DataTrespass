Lodge 76, Intern. Ass'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,..., 427 U.S. 132 (1976)

> "The question to be decided in this case is whether federal labor policy pre-empts the authority of a state labor relations board to grant an employer covered by the National Labor Relations Act an order enjoining a union and its members from continuing to refuse to work overtime pursuant to a union policy to put economic pressure on the employer in negotiations for renewal of an expired collective-bargaining agreement." ([ 1976:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5B6XCS6M?page=2))

> "the employer filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board that the Union's resolution violated s 8(b)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act," ([ 1976:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5B6XCS6M?page=3))

> "The Regional Director dismissed the charge on the ground that the "policy prohibiting overtime work by its member employees . . . does not appear to be in violation of the Act" and therefore was not conduct cognizable by the Board under NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U.S. 477" ([ 1976:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5B6XCS6M?page=3))

> "the employer **2551 also filed a complaint before the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission charging that the refusal to work overtime constituted an unfair labor practice under state law" ([ 1976:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5B6XCS6M?page=3))

> "Cases that have held state authority to be preempted by federal law tend to fall into one of two categories: (1) those that reflect the concern that "one forum would enjoin, as illegal, conduct which the other forum would find legal" and (2) those that reflect the concern "that the (application of state law by) state courts would restrict the exercise of rights guaranteed by the Federal Acts."" ([ 1976:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5B6XCS6M?page=3))

> "distinguish pre-emption based on federal protection of the conduct in question . . . from that based predominantly" ([ 1976:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5B6XCS6M?page=3))

> "on the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board" ([ 1976:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5B6XCS6M?page=4))

> "We consider first pre-emption based predominantly on the primary jurisdiction of the Board." ([ 1976:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5B6XCS6M?page=4))

> "San Diego Unions v. Garmon" ([ 1976:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5B6XCS6M?page=4))

> "a second line of pre-emption analysis has been developed in cases focusing upon the crucial inquiry whether Congress intended that the conduct involved be unregulated because left "to be controlled by the free play of economic forces." NLRB v. Nash-Finch Co., 404 U.S. 138," ([ 1976:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5B6XCS6M?page=4))

> "a particular activity might be "protected" by federal law not only when it fell within s 7, but also when it was an activity that Congress intended to be "unrestricted by Any governmental power to regulate" because it was among the permissible "economic weapons in reserve, . . . actual exercise (of which) on occasion by the parties, is part and parcel of the system that the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts have recognized." NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U.S., at 488-489" ([ 1976:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5B6XCS6M?page=5))

> "certain activity 'neither protected nor prohibited' be deemed privileged against state regulation." Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U.S. 181, 187" ([ 1976:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5B6XCS6M?page=5))
