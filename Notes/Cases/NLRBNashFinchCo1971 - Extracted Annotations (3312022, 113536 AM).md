> "NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v. NASH-FINCH CO., DBA JACK & JILL STORES." ([ 1971:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=1))

> ""A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments." ([ 1971:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=1))

> "The question is whether the National Labor Relations Board may, through proceedings in a federal court, enjoin *140 a state court order which regulates peaceful picketing governed by the federal agency." ([ 1971:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=1))

> "the union filed unfair labor practice charges against the company. The General Counsel issued a complaint. A hearing was held and a Trial Examiner sustained the complaint and recommended that the company cease and desist." ([ 1971:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=1))

> "before the Board had acted, the union picketed the stores. The company thereupon petitioned the Nebraska state court for an injunction. The state court issued a restraining order," ([ 1971:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=1))

> "Neb. Rev. Stat. § 28-812, which makes unlawful "loitering about, picketing or patrolling the place of work . . . against the will of such person" ([ 1971:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=1))

> "the injunction bars anyone, other than pickets and named defendants, from picketing, distributing handbills, or otherwise "caus[ing] to be published *141 or broadcast any information pertaining to the dispute . . . between the parties." ([ 1971:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=2))

> "the Board entered its decision and order accepting in part the Trial Examiner's recommendations" ([ 1971:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=2))

> "The Board then filed this suit in the Federal District Court seeking to restrain the enforcement of the state court injunction on the ground that it regulated conduct which was governed exclusively by the National Labor Relations Act." ([ 1971:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=2))

> "It is suggested that this federal injunction was "in aid" of the jurisdiction of the federal court since the suit is in the District Court by reason of 28 U. S. C. § 1337 which grants jurisdiction over "any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce. "" ([ 1971:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=2))

> "Section 10 (j) gives the District Court similar authority in respect of an unfair labor practice of the employer under § 8 (a) (1) of the Act which protects the right of employees to organize. But a resort to court action, the Board has held, does not violate § 8 (a) (1). See Clyde Taylor Co., 127 N. L. R. B. 103, 109." ([ 1971:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=2))

> "The action in the instant case does not seek an injunction to restrain specific activities upon which the Board has issued a complaint but is based upon the general doctrine of pre-emption. We therefore do not believe this case falls within the narrow exception contained in § 2283 for matters "necessary in aid of its jurisdiction There is in the Act no express authority for the Board to seek injunctive relief against pre-empted state action. The question remains whether there is implied authority to do so" ([ 1971:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=2))

> "We conclude that there is also an implied authority of the Board, in spite of the command of § 2283, to enjoin state action where its federal power pre-empts the field." ([ 1971:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VDC5N9C?page=3))
