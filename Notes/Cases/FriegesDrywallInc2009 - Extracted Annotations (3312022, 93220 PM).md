title: Frieges Drywall (2009)

Court of Appeals of Minnesota.


> "the union has been picketing at Friedges's work sites to protest the wages and benefits that Friedges pays its workers, which the union claims are lower than area standards" ([ 2009:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IVR3TEX6?page=1))

> "Friedges initiated a civil action against the union, alleging unfair labor practices under Minn.Stat. §§ 179.11(5), (6), (7), .13 (2008), and trespass." ([ 2009:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IVR3TEX6?page=2))

> "The district court found the union's preemption argument meritorious, particularly in light of the fact that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had previously reviewed and rejected similar claims." ([ 2009:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IVR3TEX6?page=2))

> "As the Supreme Court held in Garmon, when an activity is clearly or "arguably" protected by section 7 or prohibited by section 8 of the NLRA, states lack jurisdiction to regulate the activity, even if the NLRB declines to assert or exercise jurisdiction in a particular case. 359 U.S. at 245-46 state courts may neither enjoin nor award damages for activities that are at least arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA. Id. at 246-47, states may retain the power to intervene in labor disputes if the activity concerned is "merely peripheral" to the federal regulatory scheme, the activity touches interests "deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility," or invocation of another rule is unlikely to "disserve the interests promoted by the federal labor statutes." Farmer v. United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners of Am., 430 U.S. 290, 296-97, 97 S.Ct. 1056, 1061-62, 51 L.Ed.2d 338 (1977)" ([ 2009:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IVR3TEX6?page=2))

> ""[c]onsiderations of federal supremacy" underlying Garmon preemption "are implicated to a greater extent when labor-related activity is protected than when it is prohibited." See Sears, 436 U.S. at 200" ([ 2009:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IVR3TEX6?page=3))

> "Courts traditionally have interpreted the Garmon localinterests exception as permitting states to intervene in labor disputes to protect their interest in preventing violence and other malicious behavior. See id. at 204" ([ 2009:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IVR3TEX6?page=3))

> "Friedges filed a claim with the NLRB, claiming that the union had engaged in unfair labor practices prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 158(b)(4)(ii)(A), (B) (2006). The NLRB concluded that there was insufficient evidence of a violation. Friedges apparently did not appeal the decision" ([ 2009:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IVR3TEX6?page=5))
