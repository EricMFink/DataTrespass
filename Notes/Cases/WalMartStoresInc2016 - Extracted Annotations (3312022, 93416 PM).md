Walmart Stores, Inc. v. United Food and Commercial..., 4 Cal.App.5th 194 (2016)

> "the trial court issued a permanent injunction barring defendants United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) and Organization United for Respect at Walmart (OUR Walmart; collectively the union) from conducting demonstrations inside stores owned by Wal-Mart Stores," ([ 2016:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=3))

> "the union contends the trial court had no jurisdiction to enter the injunction because the matter was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. § 151, et seq.; NLRA). We conclude the NLRA does not preempt Walmart's trespass action." ([ 2016:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=3))

> "Walmart filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). In the charge, Walmart alleged defendants violated Section 8, subdivision (b)(1)(A) of the NLRA" ([ 2016:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=3))

> "by "planning, orchestrating, and conducting a series of unauthorized and blatantly trespassory in-store mass demonstrations, invasive 'flash mobs,' and other confrontational group activities at numerous facilities nationwide ... by which the UFCW restrained and coerced employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights (which includes the right to refrain from supporting the UFCW) by attempting to impose its will on local facility management in front of facility employees through the sheer force of a mass of moving bodies despite requests and direction by local management to leave."" ([ 2016:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=4))

> "Walmart's counsel represented in an Arkansas court that Walmart had withdrawn the charges with respect to the in-store demonstrations." ([ 2016:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=4))

> "Walmart filed a complaint in the Los Angeles superior court for trespass, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the union." ([ 2016:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=4))

> "The union argued the action was preempted because the NLRA arguably prohibited the union conduct Walmart was seeking to enjoin. The union did not argue its conduct was arguably protected under the NLRA." ([ 2016:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=4))

> "The trial court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the union, and persons acting in concert with the union (excluding Walmart employees), from entering Walmart's stores to engage in "unlawful activities, such as picketing, patrolling, marching, parading, 'flash mobs,' demonstrations, handbilling, solicitation, manager confrontations, or customer disruptions...." The injunction does not prohibit union representatives from accompanying a Walmart employee in discussions with a manager to discuss labor conditions." ([ 2016:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=4))

> "Whether the NLRA preempts a cause of action is an issue of law we review de novo." ([ 2016:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=5))

> "As set forth in San Diego Unions v Garmon (1959) 359 U.S. 236, 79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775 (Garmon), the NLRB has exclusive jurisdiction *201  over disputes involving unfair labor practices, and "state jurisdiction must yield" when state action would regulate conduct governed by the NLRA. (Id at pp. 244-245, 79 S.Ct. 773.)" ([ 2016:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=5))

> "if the conduct at issue is arguably prohibited or protected otherwise applicable state law and procedures are ordinarily pre-empted When, however, the conduct at issue is only a peripheral concern of the Act or touches on interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, it could not be inferred that Congress intended to deprive the State of the power to act, we refuse to invalidate state regulation or sanction of the conduct."" ([ 2016:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=5))

> "A court first determines whether the "conduct that the State seeks ... to make the basis of liability is actually or arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA." (Jones, supra, 460 U.S. at p. 676, 103 S.Ct. 1453.) If, despite being arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA, the conduct at issue involves a deeply-rooted local interest, the question of whether the state action is allowed "involves a sensitive balancing of any harm to the regulatory scheme established by Congress, either in terms of negating the Board's exclusive jurisdiction or in terms of conflicting substantive rules, and the importance of the asserted cause of action to the state as a protection to its citizens."" ([ 2016:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=5))

> "Sears, Roebuck & Co v. Carpenters (1978) 436 U.S. 180, 98 S.Ct. 1745, 56 L.Ed.2d 209 (Sears), in which the high court established an analytical framework to determine Garmon preemption issues, including the application of the local interest exception, in the context of a California trespass case" ([ 2016:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=6))

> "The Sears court set forth two guides for evaluating preemption, one for conduct the NLRA arguably prohibits, and one for conduct the NLRA arguably protects." ([ 2016:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=6))

> "The dissent in Sears—Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Stewart and Marshall" ([ 2016:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=18))

> "A state court may, of course, enjoin any picketing that is clearly unprotected by the Act, e.g., peaceful, nonobstructive picketing occurring within a retail store. [Citations.] And, as already indicated, state courts have jurisdiction over picketing that is obstructive, or involves large groups of persons, or otherwise entails a serious threat of violence." (Id. at pp. 226-227, 98 S.Ct. 1745, italics added.)" ([ 2016:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=18))

> "In discussing preemption of claims challenging arguably protected conduct, the Court reasoned: "The primary-jurisdiction rationale justifies preemption only in situations in which an aggrieved party has a reasonable opportunity either to invoke the Board's jurisdiction himself or else to induce his adversary to do so. ... The primary-jurisdiction rationale unquestionably requires that when the same controversy may be presented to the state court or the NLRB, it must be presented to the Board. But that rationale does not extend to cases in which an employer has no acceptable method of invoking, or inducing the Union to invoke, the jurisdiction of the Board." (Sears, supra, 436 U.S. at pp. 201-202, 98 S.Ct. 1745, fn. omitted.)" ([ 2016:19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LPU7JBEU?page=19))
