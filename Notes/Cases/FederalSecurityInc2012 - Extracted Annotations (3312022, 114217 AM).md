> "The judge found that the filing and maintenance of the Respondents' suit violated Section 8(a)(1) under two separate theories, both of which have their origins in the Supreme Court's decision in Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB. Bill Johnson's, "retaliatory motive and lack of reasonable basis are both essential prerequisites to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order against a state suit." 5, footnote We are not dealing with a suit that is claimed to be beyond the jurisdiction of the state courts because of federal-law preemption . at the Board's request, a District Court may enjoin enforcement of a state-court injunction "where [the Board's] federal power pre-empts the field.""

> "In support of his finding that the lawsuit was preempted, the judge relied on Manno Electric, Inc. In Manno Electric, the Board considered an employer's State-court lawsuit alleging, in part, that employees made false statements to the Board with a malicious intent to injure the employer.
