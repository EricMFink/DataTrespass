> "unlawful on two independent grounds: because certain of the claims asserted were preempted by the Act and because all of the claims were baseless and retaliatory." ([ 2018:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JNZKVHCT?page=2))

> "Respondent (not Remington) filed a lawsuit against the Union in federal district court alleging six counts of tortious interference with contractual and prospective relations and one count of defamation" ([ 2018:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JNZKVHCT?page=2))

> "The Supreme Court addressed the status of preempted lawsuits in connection with labor disputes in Bill Johnson's Restaurants v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731 (1983)." ([ 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JNZKVHCT?page=4))

> "We are not dealing with a suit that is claimed to be beyond the jurisdiction of the state courts because of federal-law preemption, or a suit that has an objective that is illegal under federal law. Petitioner concedes that the Board may enjoin these latter types of suits. . . . Nor could it be successfully argued otherwise, for we have upheld Board orders enjoining unions from prosecuting court suits for enforcement of fines that could not lawfully be imposed under the Act," ([ 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JNZKVHCT?page=4))

> "this Court has concluded that, at the Board's request, a District Court may enjoin enforcement of a state-court injunction "where [the Board's] federal power pre-empts the field."" ([ 2018:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JNZKVHCT?page=5))

> "The continued vitality of the Bill Johnson's exemption for preempted lawsuits was later recognized by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Can-Am Plumbing v. NLRB, 321 F.3d 145 (D.C. Cir. 2003)" ([ 2018:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JNZKVHCT?page=5))

> "a preempted lawsuit enjoys no special protection under the First Amendment and may be found to violate the Act if it is unlawful under traditional NLRA principles; that is, it may be found unlawful if it has a tendency to interfere with the free exercise of a Section 7 right." ([ 2018:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JNZKVHCT?page=5))

> "The Respondent's tortious interference allegations were preempted because they were based on, and targeted, the Union's consumer boycott of the hotel. As a general matter, an action brought under state law is preempted when "it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by [Section] 7 of the National Labor Relations Act." San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon, supra, 359 U.S. at 244" ([ 2018:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JNZKVHCT?page=5))

> "the Respondent's lawsuit, insofar as it asserted claims of tortious interference with contractual and prospective relations, was preempted by the Act. Further, because those claims plainly had a tendency to interfere with conduct that is protected by Section 7 (the Union's consumer boycott), the Respondent violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act by filing and maintaining them." ([ 2018:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JNZKVHCT?page=6))

> "See, e.g., Can-Am Plumbing, Inc., 335 NLRB 1217, 1217 (2001), enf. denied on other grounds and remanded 321 F.3d 145 (D.C. Cir. 2003), reaffd. 350 NLRB 947 (2007), enfd. 340 Fed. Appx. 354 (9th Cir. 2009)" ([ 2018:21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JNZKVHCT?page=21))
