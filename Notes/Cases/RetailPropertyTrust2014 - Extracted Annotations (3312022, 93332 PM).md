> "In this case we must decide whether § 303 of the Labor Management Relations *942  Act ("LMRA"), codified at 29 U.S.C. § 187, preempts state-law claims for trespass and private nuisance related to union conduct that may also constitute secondary boycott activity" ([ 2014:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=5))

> "we hold that federal law does not so thoroughly occupy the field that it always preempts such claims, nor does it conflict with the state law claims presented here. Where, as in this case, state claims of trespass and nuisance "touch[ ] interests deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility,"" ([ 2014:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=5))

> "and the plaintiff seeks only to enforce time, place, and manner restrictions against union protesters," ([ 2014:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=5))

> "Section 303 prohibits, through cross-reference to 29 U.S.C. § 158, labor organizations or their agents from "threaten[ing], coerc[ing], or restrain[ing] any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce, where ... an object thereof is ... forcing or requiring any person to ... cease doing business with any other person."" ([ 2014:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=7))

> "a defendant ordinarily cannot remove a case based on the assertion of a federal defense, but found there was a "complete preemption" exception where "any claim purportedly based on that preempted state law is considered, from its inception, a federal claim, and therefore arises under federal law." Balcorta v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., 208 F.3d 1102, 1107 (9th Cir.2000); see also Smart v. Local 702 Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 562 F.3d 798, 808 (7th Cir.2009)" ([ 2014:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=7))

> ""Complete" Preemption v. Defensive Preemption" ([ 2014:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=9))

> "The well-pleaded complaint rule means that "a case may not be removed to federal court on the basis of a federal defense, including the defense of pre-emption, even if the defense is anticipated in the plaintiff's complaint" ([ 2014:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=9))

> "there are some federal statutes that have such "extraordinary pre-emptive power" that they "convert[ ] an ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule." Metro. Life Ins., 481 U.S. at 65, 107 S.Ct. 1542. "Once an area of state law has been completely pre-empted, any claim purportedly based on that pre-empted state law is considered, from its inception, a federal claim, and therefore arises under federal law." Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 393," ([ 2014:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=9))

> "[c]omplete preemption is really a jurisdictional rather than a preemption doctrine, as it confers exclusive federal jurisdiction in certain instances where Congress intended the scope of federal law to be so broad as to entirely replace any state-law claim." ([ 2014:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=9))

> "Garmon preemption deals specifically with when a labor matter must be brought before the NLRB, a complicated doctrine known as primary jurisdiction." ([ 2014:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=12))

> "In this case, the Mall had "no right to invoke [the Board's primary] jurisdiction," and the Union—the party that could have brought the matter before the Board—failed to do so. Accordingly, Garmon preemption is not at issue here." ([ 2014:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=12))

> "The Court acknowledged that it was unclear whether *952  the union's conduct was protected under § 7 of the NLRA or prohibited under § 8. Id. at 245, 79 S.Ct. 773. The Court focused on whether the NLRB had primary jurisdiction to make that determination: "When an activity is arguably subject to § 7 or § 8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the [NLRB] if the danger of state interference with National policy is to be averted." Id. at 245, 79 S.Ct. 773." ([ 2014:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=12))

> "in Sears, 436 U.S. at 180, 98 S.Ct. 1745, the Court found deeply local interests to be at stake, such that Garmon preemption was inappropriate. The issue before the Court in Sears was whether the NLRA "deprives a state court of the power to entertain an action by an employer to enforce state trespass laws against picketing which is arguably—but not definitely—prohibited or protected by federal law." Id. at 182, 98 S.Ct. 1745." ([ 2014:13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=13))

> "Only if the controversy is identical to a claim that could have been presented to the Board would a state court's exercise of jurisdiction involve "a risk of interference with the unfair labor practice jurisdiction of the Board." Id" ([ 2014:14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=14))

> "because "Sears only challenged the location of the picketing," not its objective, "the controversy which Sears might have presented to the [NLRB] is not the same as the controversy presented to the state court." Id. at 198, 98 S.Ct. 1745." ([ 2014:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=16))

> "a number of courts have found preemption of state causes of action addressing economic harms. See, e.g., BE & K Constr. Co., 90 F.3d at 1327-30 (holding that, because there was insufficient evidence of union violence" ([ 2014:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=18))

> "Conflict Preemption" ([ 2014:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=18))

> "claim under Arkansas law for tortious interference with contractual relations was preempted by § 303); Iodice, 512 F.2d at 390 (holding that claim under New York law for tortious interference with contractual relations did not involve violence and was preempted by § 303); Hennepin Broad. Assocs., Inc. v. NLRB, 408 F.Supp. 932 (D.Minn.1975) (holding that Minnesota claims for tortious interference with business relations and contracts was preempted by § 303)." ([ 2014:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=18))

> "The Mall claims not the right to quash all protest activity by the Union—an expansive claim that would present a much harder question with respect to Machinists preemption—but only the right to prevent Union members from "yelling, chanting loudly in unison, blowing whistles, hitting and kicking [a] construction barricade ... and hitting their picket signs against the Mall railings."" ([ 2014:19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=19))

> "The Sears Court made the above observations with respect to the prong of the Garmon test addressing conduct arguably prohibited by the NLRA. It noted, however, that "[c]onsiderations of federal supremacy ... are implicated to a greater extent when labor-related activity is protected than when it is prohibited." Sears, 436 U.S. at 200, 98 S.Ct. 1745." ([ 2014:21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GT6HWVLT?page=21))
