Helmsley-Spear, Inc. v. Fishman, 11 N.Y.3d 470 (2008)

> "members of the Union assembled outside certain entrances of the ESB, distributing leaflets while one or more of the members drummed on a plastic container, metal pot or tin can" ([ 2008:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8S2XAZVA?page=2))

> "nonparty Copstat filed three unfair labor practice charges against the Union with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), alleging that the Union's picketing or threatened picketing violated 29 USC § 158(b)(7)(C), and that the Union's *473  activity was designed to coerce Helmsley-Spear into discontinuing business with Copstat in violation of 29 USC § 158(b)(4)(i), (ii)(B) and coerce Copstat employees into selecting the Union as their collective bargaining representative in violation of 29 USC § 158(b) (1)(A)." ([ 2008:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8S2XAZVA?page=2))

> "The NLRB dismissed the charges, finding that the Union "was engaged in protected handbilling or leafleting" and that "the use of the drum on the days in question ... was [not] sufficient to transform the leafleting activity into unlawful conduct." The NLRB's Office of Appeals affirmed that decision on the same grounds." ([ 2008:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8S2XAZVA?page=2))

> "Meanwhile, plaintiffs Helmsley-Spear and owners of nearby businesses commenced the instant private nuisance action **936  ***385  against the Union seeking an order enjoining it from engaging in drumming or other noisemaking activities." ([ 2008:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8S2XAZVA?page=2))

> "The Sears Court recognized that, even in cases where an employer has no right to invoke the Board's jurisdiction, preemption may be appropriate where "the exercise of state jurisdiction ... might create a significant risk of misinterpretation of federal law and the consequent prohibition of protected conduct"" ([ 2008:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8S2XAZVA?page=3))

> "The controversy in this case—whether the drumming constituted a private nuisance—is distinctly different from the matter presented by Copstat to the NLRB, which involved allegations that the Union engaged in impermissible picketing and coercive conduct." ([ 2008:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8S2XAZVA?page=4))

> "The Board did not proclaim the drumming to be "protected conduct" under the NLRA but, rather, premised its holding exclusively on the leafleting itself, finding that "the use of the drum ... was [not] sufficient to transform the leafleting activity into unlawful conduct." That holding did not, ipso facto, render the drumming "protected conduct," as the dissent claims, but merely determined that the drumming did not transform otherwise protected conduct into prohibited conduct." ([ 2008:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8S2XAZVA?page=4))

> "While federal law unquestionably trumps state law where there is an actual conflict, Sears focuses on the grey areas between actual conflict and no conflict at all: areas of "arguable" conflict between state tort law and federal labor law. Where such an "arguable" conflict exists, it is generally accepted that the appropriate federal tribunal should have the first chance to decide whether federal law, in fact, applies —a concept known as "primary jurisdiction." Importantly, primary jurisdiction lies at the core of Sears, which explicitly relied on the defendant union's failure to seek an adjudication before the NLRB in reaching its holding:" ([ 2008:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8S2XAZVA?page=6))

> "Neither the use of [a King Kong] costume nor the use of the drum on the days in question, as described above, was sufficient to transform the leafleting activity into unlawful conduct"" ([ 2008:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8S2XAZVA?page=7))
