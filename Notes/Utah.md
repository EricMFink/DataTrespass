title: Utah Ag-Gag Law

### Utah 

Utah's ag-gag law,[^Utah1] makes "agricultural operation interference" a misdemeanor: 

> A person is guilty of agricultural operation interference if the person:
> 
> (a\) without consent from the owner of the agricultural operation, or the owner's agent, knowingly or intentionally records an image of, or sound from, the agricultural operation by leaving a recording device on the agricultural operation;
> 
> (b\) obtains access to an agricultural operation under false pretenses;
> 
> (c\)
> 
> > (i\) applies for employment at an agricultural operation with the intent to record an image of, or sound from, the agricultural operation;
> > 
> > (ii\) knows, at the time that the person accepts employment at the agricultural operation, that the owner of the agricultural operation prohibits the employee from recording an image of, or sound from, the agricultural operation; and
> > 
> > (iii\) while employed at, and while present on, the agricultural operation, records an image of, or sound from, the agricultural operation; or
> 
> (d\) without consent from the owner of the operation or the owner's agent, knowingly or intentionally records an image of, or sound from, an agricultural operation while the person is committing criminal trespass, as described in Section 76-6-206, on the agricultural operation.[^1Utah2]

In _Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Herbert_, the court held that "ยง 76-6-112 is unconstitutional" on First Amendment grounds.[^Utah3] However, the statute has not been repealed or amended.[^4]

Another Utah statute imposes enhanced penalties for "any criminal offense with the intent to halt, impede, obstruct, or interfere with the lawful operation of an animal enterprise or to damage, take, or cause the loss of any property owned by, used by, or in the possession of a lawful animal enterprise".[^Utah10] The enhanced penalty provision under ยง 76-6-110 "does not apply to action protected by the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 151 et seq., or the Federal Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. Section 151 et seq."[^Utah11]
